* June 30: Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda talks Slashdot, Perl, moderation, and more!
    * Time: 6:00p-8:00p EDT
    * Description: Join us on June 30th for a special event featuring Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda, founder of Slashdot, as he talks about the quirkiness of Perl that led them to build Slashcode using our favorite language, the challenges of scaling Slashdot in the early days, and how they built up a system to deal with bad actors. We will leave time for Q&A at the end, but feel free to send your questions in advance of the talk.

* July 28: Post-COVID Social Extravaganza
    * Time: 6:00p-8:00p EDT
    * Location: Lost Worlds Brewing, Cornelius, NC
    * Description: Our first in-person social event since the world
      changed in March of 2020. Come and have some drinks, enjoy a food
      truck, and hang out in person with other Perl mongers. There is no
      tech content this month - just hang out and have fun!
* August 25: Configuration Round Table (blame Yanick!)
    * Time: 6:00p-8:00p EDT
    * Description: Everyone has their own way of configuring their
      workstations, laptops, etc. These range from the religious
      experience to a sloppy directory of barely coherent shell scripts,
      and most everything in between. Yanick and I were talking about
      this recently, and realized not only how much we learned in that
      conversation, but what we could all learn talking to each other.
      The intent of this session is to openly discuss how we each
      approach this to share information. We all have something to learn
      here!
